A student can only pass a course so long as they meet the following lab
attendance criteria:
• They missed fewer than 2 labs
• They were never late for 3 consecutive labs
Demonstrators record a string representing a student’s track record – ‘A’ for
absent, ‘L’ for late, ‘P’ for present
Write a recursive program that takes in one of these strings and outputs
whether the student should fail or not. If you can’t think of how to do it
recursively then just do it in any way!
