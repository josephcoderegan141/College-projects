A Java program that inserts English to Spanish translations into a binary tree to enable fast translation of text (EnglishSpanish.csv).
The program takes English text as input and output the Spanish version by looking up one word after the other in the binary tree.
I also tried to implement a function that would count and print the height of the tree however i was unsucessful this function and print statement in commented out in the source
code.
